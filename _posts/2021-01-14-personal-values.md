One of the topics we discussed in the recent Endurance PhD Intensive was the importance of matching your goals with your personal values. I just completed [this quiz](https://personalvalu.es/personal-values-list) to rank my top values. I originally selected 22 values from the list, and the quiz reported my top 5 [results here](https://personalvalu.es/results/4309691d-3384-45fe-aace-55fdb394aae6). This quiz was difficult because I felt like so many of the values were related to me. The way I made my decision in a tie was ask which value was _a result of_ the other value? More details of how I nested these values is below.

1. _Authenticity_. I interpret this as being genuine and truthful about my goals, ambitions, and values. I feel uncomfortable when I lie to other people. Some values that stem from Authenticity are: uniqueness, honesty, curiosity
2. _Accountability_. I interpret this as being someone that other people can count on. If I say I'm going to do something, I will deliver. I never want to be considered the flaky friend. Some values that stem from Accountability are: loyalty, honesty, commitment
3. _Certainty_. I don't like surprises. I prefer having a schedule that stays the same from day to day. This leaves me mental energy to work on more important things. However, I am working on being more flexible when necessary! Some values that stem from Certainty are: security, financial stability, trust
4. _Control_. I want to have as much information about my situation as possible, especially when making a decision. This is what allows me to maintain certainty and accountability. Some values that stem from Control are: peace, appreciation, privacy
5. _Discipline_. I like to be oriented towards a long-term goal. I haven't been good at resisting temptation (like sugar or sleeping in) lately, but I am working towards building up that stamina again. Some values that stem from Discipline are: growth (another big one for me), excellence, respect, challenge
