# Version 2
I'm feeling a bit frustrated that I am already adjusting this, but after some great conversations with my therapist and my roommate, I think I have come up with a plan that is more sustainable. With version 1 below, I was already feeling overwhelmed thinking that I _need_ to check off everything every day. I've learned I need to give myself some _grace_, as my therapist puts it, so that I can still say I showed up for myself even if the energy and motivation is low that day. Overall, I just want to get back to feeling like I am in control of my schedule again. Then we can get down to optimizing!

# Version 1
New Year's resolutions are hard. Instead of making a yearly goal that is hard to stick to, the theme of the year is _consistency and sustainability_. I want to make habits that are flexible and will last for years. Therefore, I have identified 6 main areas of my life I want to improve and will make a monthly goal. Each month's goal will be a small item to focus on for the whole month. If it doesn't work, I will try something else the next month. Otherwise, I will build off of it in the following month! This page will get updated over the course of the year along with notes about the process.
