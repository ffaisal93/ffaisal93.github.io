Hi there, I'm Fahim!

I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.gmu.edu/) and part of the [GMU NLP group](https://cs.gmu.edu/~antonis/) at George Mason University, where I am advised by [Dr. Antonios Anastasopoulos](https://cs.gmu.edu/~antonis/author/antonios-anastasopoulos/). My research focuses on adapting language models for low-resource languages. More broadly, I am interested in exploring the intersection of language and computational modeling.

<p style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">
  I am in the job market. Graduating later this year (Fall 2025) looking for postdoc, machine-learning engineer, research scientist positions as well as summer 2025 internships.  <a href="https://fahimfaisal.info/assets/pdf/academic_cv_fahim_faisal.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: blue; ">(my cv)</a>
