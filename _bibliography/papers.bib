    abstract = "Automated source code summarization is a popular software engineering research topic wherein machine translation models are employed to {``}translate{''} code snippets into relevant natural language descriptions. Most evaluations of such models are conducted using automatic reference-based metrics. However, given the relatively large semantic gap between programming languages and natural language, we argue that this line of research would benefit from a qualitative investigation into the various error modes of current state-of-the-art models. Therefore, in this work, we perform both a quantitative and qualitative comparison of three recently proposed source code summarization models. In our quantitative evaluation, we compare the models based on the smoothed BLEU-4, METEOR, and ROUGE-L machine translation metrics, and in our qualitative evaluation, we perform a manual open-coding of the most common errors committed by the models when compared to ground truth captions. Our investigation reveals new insights into the relationship between metric-based performance and model prediction errors grounded in an error taxonomy that can be used to drive future research efforts.",

Arguably, the most important factor influencing the quality of modern NLP systems is data availability. In this work, we study the geographical representativeness of NLP datasets, aiming to quantify if and by how much do NLP datasets match the expected needs of the language speakers. In doing so, we use entity recognition and linking systems, also making important observations about their cross-lingual consistency and giving suggestions for more robust evaluation. Last, we explore some geographical and economic factors that may explain the observed dataset distributions.",

However, current benchmarks in QA research do not account for the errors that speech recognition models might introduce, nor do they consider the language variations (dialects) of the users. To address this gap, we augment an existing QA dataset to construct a multi-dialect, spoken QA benchmark on five languages (Arabic, Bengali, English, Kiswahili, Korean) with more than 68k audio prompts in 24 dialects from 255 speakers. We provide baseline results showcasing the real-world performance of QA systems and analyze the effect of language variety and other sensitive speaker attributes on downstream performance. Last, we study the fairness of the ASR and QA models with respect to the underlying user populations.",

Hence, for information-seeking question answering (QA) systems to adequately serve speakers of all languages, they need to operate cross-lingually. In this work we investigate the capabilities of multilingually pretrained language models on cross-lingual QA. We find that explicitly aligning the representations across languages with a post-hoc finetuning step generally leads to improved performance. We additionally investigate the effect of data size as well as the language choice in this fine-tuning step, also releasing a dataset for evaluating cross-lingual QA systems.",

abstract = {Literature-based discovery process identifies the important but implicit relations among information embedded in published literature. Existing techniques from Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) attempt to identify the hidden or unpublished connections between information concepts within published literature, however, these techniques overlooked the concept of predicting the future and emerging relations among scientific knowledge components such as author selected keywords encapsulated within the literature. Keyword Co-occurrence Network (KCN), built upon author selected keywords, is considered as a knowledge graph that focuses both on these knowledge components and knowledge structure of a scientific domain by examining the relationships between knowledge entities. Using data from two multidisciplinary research domains other than the bio-medical domain, and capitalizing on bibliometrics, the dynamicity of temporal KCNs, and a recurrent neural network, this study develops some novel features supportive for the prediction of the future literature-based discoveries - the emerging connections (co-appearances in the same article) among keywords. Temporal importance extracted from both bipartite and unipartite networks, communities defined by genealogical relations, and the relative importance of temporal citation counts were used in the feature construction process. Both node and edge-level features were input into a recurrent neural network to forecast the feature values and predict the future relations between different scientific concepts/topics represented by the author selected keywords. High performance rates, compared both against contemporary heterogeneous network-based method and preferential attachment process, suggest that these features complement both the prediction of future literature-based discoveries and emerging trend analysis.},
